--- The file name of this lua file is important, it will act as the skin's ID.
--- Make sure to name it something that another modder is unlikely to use!

local skin = {
    --- Name - The name of your custom skin. This will be shown on the Customize Deck UI in-game.
    name = "K4Color",
    --- Suit - This is the suit that your skin is assigned to-- Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, or Spades.
    ---        For this example, the skin is set to "C", so the suit is Clubs.
    ---        The code will also accept a lowercase letter (like "c"),
    ---        or the suit name in all lowercase or with the first letter capitalized (like "Clubs" or "clubs")
    suit = "diamonds",
    --- Texture - This is the name of your texture that will be used for you skin.
    ---           It should correspond to two files of the same name in the /assets/1x/ and /assets/2x/ folders.
    ---           Like the lua file, make sure its filename is unique!
    texture = "K4CL_diamonds.png",
    --- High Contrast Texture - This is an OPTIONAL value.
    ---                         If you don't want to have an alternate version of your skin with high contrast colors,
    ---                         Then keep this value set to nil. If you do want to support high contrast, then replace
    ---                         the nil with another texture file name, like "example_2.png". Make sure its wrapped in quotes!
